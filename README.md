A modern, "page-wise" personal portfolio website designed for a Data Analyst and Digital Cyber Crime Analyst. This project features a Single Page Application (SPA) feel without the need for frameworks, utilizing vanilla JavaScript for navigation and **Three.js** for an immersive, interactive 3D background.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Interactive 3D Background:** A dynamic particle and geometric shape system built with Three.js that responds to mouse movement.
* **Page-Wise Navigation:** Unlike traditional scrolling sites, this portfolio uses a tab-based system to switch views instantly with a smooth fade-in animation.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** semi-transparent, blurred card designs that float above the 3D background.
* **Fully Responsive:** optimized layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Zero Dependencies:** No `npm install` required. The Three.js library is loaded via CDN.
